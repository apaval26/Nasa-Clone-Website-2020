	NASA stands for National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA is a U.S. government agency that is responsible for science and technology related to air and space. The Space Age started in 1957 with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik.
  
  NASA opened for business on Oct. 1, 1958. The agency was created to oversee U.S. space exploration and aeronautics research.

  <p class = "text">The administrator is in charge of NASA. The NASA administrator is nominated by the president and confirmed by a vote in the Senate.</p>


	
		<p class="text">NASA is led by Administrator Jim Bridenstine, NASA's 13th administrator. Before joining NASA, Bridenstine served in the U.S. Congress, representing Oklahoma’s First Congressional District, serving on the Armed Services Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee.</p>
		  
		
		  
		<p class = "text">Bridenstine’s career in federal service began in the U.S. Navy, flying the E-2C Hawkeye off the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier.He flew combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and accrued most of his 1,900 flight hours and 333 carrier-arrested landings. </p>

       <p class = "text"> He was nominated by President Donald Trump, confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and sworn in as NASA’s 13th administrator on April 23, 2018. Bridenstine was elected in 2012 to represent Oklahoma’s First Congressional District. In Congress he served on the Armed Services Committee and the Science, Space and Technology Committee.  </p>
		  
	   <p class = "text">NASA helps teachers prepare students who will be the engineers, scientists, astronauts and other NASA workers of the future. They will be the adventurers who will continue exploration of the solar system and universe. NASA has a tradition of investing in programs and activities that inspire students, educators, families and communities in the excitement and discovery of exploration. NASA offers training to help teachers learn new ways to teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The agency also involves students in NASA missions to help them get excited about learning </p>
		  
	   <p class = "text"> NASA’s Headquarters is in Washington, D.C. The agency has nine centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and seven test and research facilities located in several states around the country. More than 17,000 people work for NASA. Many more people work with the agency as government contractors. These people are hired by companies that NASA pays to do work.</p>
		  
		<p class = "text"> When NASA started, it began a program of human spaceflight. The Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs helped NASA learn about flying in space and resulted in the first human landing on the Moon in 1969. Currently, NASA has astronauts living and working on the International Space Station.</p>

       <p class = "text"> Many NASA workers are scientists and engineers. But people there hold many other jobs, too, from secretaries to writers to lawyers to teachers.</p>
		  
	   <p class = "text"> Overall, our main purpose is to  discover and expand knowledge for the benefit of humanity.</p>
